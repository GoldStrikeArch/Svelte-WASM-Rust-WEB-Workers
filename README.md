# Svelte-WASM-Rust-WEB-Workers
An example with Svelte + Rust WASM module (inside Web Worker)

The Rust's code is inside /Rust folder
The Svelte's code is inside /Svelte folder

This example is using Web Workers API, so rollup config is updated accordingly.

# Note !!! As of now (10 Dec 2021) you have to manually install a local version of ```bash wasm-pack``` with ```bash cargo install wasm-pack``` if you have Apple Silicon (M1)
